# FEND_Resume

## Overview

The `FEND_Resume` repository is part of the Udacity Front-End Nanodegree program. It is designed to help learners build a professional resume using web technologies such as HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. The project not only focuses on the fundamentals of web design and development but also emphasizes the importance of a visually appealing and structured resume.

### Project Structure

The repository is organized as follows:

- `index.html`: The main HTML document that serves as the entry point of the resume.
- `css/`: This directory contains the CSS files that style the resume.
  - `main.css`: The primary stylesheet for the resume.
- `js/`: This directory holds JavaScript files that add interactivity to the resume.
  - `resumeBuilder.js`: Contains the logic to dynamically build the resume content.
- `assets/`: Contains images and other assets used by the resume.
- `docs/`: Documentation related to the project, including guidelines and references.
